**Game-title**
Futurama-man -- a play on the original Hangman game with a 'Futurama' theme. Hangman involves a player guessing a word (represented by a row of dashes) given a hint. The player will guess letter by letter, with correct a letter showing in the dashes, and an incorrect letter removing a life. If the player does not guess the word correctly within six guesses, the game is over and the player has lost. The game can be played again with a new word to guess by pressing the "Play Again" button.
